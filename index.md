> ## Workshop Description
> This workshop presents the overall **workflow of Data Science and Machine Learning in R programming language** from data collection, data cleansing, data wrangling, data partition to Supervised/Unsupervised Machine Learning: pre/postprocessing and present the final output via R-Markdown, Github markdown or HTML/PDF format. The workflow can be done via RStudio on students' PC or SMU HPC Open OnDemand running on ManeFrame 3 platform to utilize the computational power of M3 HPC.
> By the end of this workshop, students are given a chance to work on real projects using Kaggle's datasets to practice using the workflow from A-Z
